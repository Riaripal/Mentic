# Mentic_Mind

We have built a web app that tracks one's mental well-being and acts accordingly. <br> Upon Logging in as a user, the user will land at the home page. The user can read different articles based on their mood. The home page also lists the various specialists registered with the website and other testimonials. On navigating to the services page, the user will be able to see the various features that the web app offers. Firstly, there is a mood tracker which calculates a score based upon the user input and then suggests the specialists and the peer persons that the user should contact to share about his problem. The user can choose who he wants to talk with and can directly have a personalized chat with them. There is also a community chat where the user can chat anonymously or with their registered username and post about their feelings.
